This ArcPy code automates standard ArcMap tools to classify C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) VV and VH rasters into: River ice, Open water, Less-certain river ice, Less-certain water. 
If you calibrate SAR to sigma-naught, use the sigma-naught code. 
If you calibrate SAR to gamma-naught, use the gamma-naught code.
This code is associated with the article: Engram et al., 2024, Remote Sensing of Environment, "Detecting early winter open-water zones on Alaska rivers using dual-polarized C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR)", DOI pending.
